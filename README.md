# Hotel Management System (React + Redux)

A simple **Hotel Management System** built using **React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, and JSON Server**.
This project allows users to view rooms, make reservations, and manage bookings using CRUD operations.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Hotel Management System is a web application that helps manage hotel room bookings.
Users can view available rooms, reserve a room, and check reservation details.

The application uses **Redux for state management** and **JSON Server as a mock backend API** to simulate real server operations.

## 🔧 Setup JSON Server (Mock Backend)

Create a file called **db.json** in the root folder.

Example:

```
{
  "rooms": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Deluxe Room",
      "type": "Deluxe",
      "price": 3000,
      "available": true
    }
  ],
  "reservations": []
}
```

Run JSON Server:

```
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
```

API endpoints:

```
http://localhost:5000/rooms
http://localhost:5000/reservations
```

---

## 📊 Application Workflow

1. Rooms are fetched from the API and displayed.
2. Users can book a room using the reservation form.
3. The reservation is saved to JSON Server.
4. Reservation list fetches and displays booking data.
5. Users can cancel reservations.

## 🎯 Key Concepts Used

* React Functional Components
* React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
* Redux Global State Management
* Redux Thunk for async API calls
* React Router for navigation
* Bootstrap for responsive UI
